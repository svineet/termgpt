# To-do and Ideas

## Initial Steps
- Develop a CLI assistant that constructs and executes commands on your behalf, while maintaining the context of the conversation.
- Enable the assistant to perform tasks autonomously.

## Features to Implement

### Slash Commands
- Implement slash commands for:
  - Model configuration
  - Direct `/bash` command execution
  - Help documentation

### User Interface Enhancements
- Integrate `prompt_toolkit` for an improved UI experience and autocomplete functionality.
- Add autocomplete powered by a lightweight language model or an alternative fuzzy finding method.

### Voice Input
- Enable voice input functionality with the `/voice` command.

## Future Developments
- Enhance the assistant to plan actions, build code repositories, and operate the computer, evolving into a comprehensive AI agent.

### Long-Term Memory
- Implement long-term memory capabilities with commands like `show memory`.
- Introduce a `<memory>` tag to store and recall memories for long-term retention.

### Agency and Autonomy
- Develop the ability to plan actions and persist until tasks are completed or the user intervenes.
- Incorporate self-reflection mechanisms.

### README Enhancements
- Revise the `README.md` to be more engaging and humorous.
  - Steps:
    1. Read the current README.
    2. Rewrite it with a more lively tone.

### Additional Tools
- Integrate tools for web searching.

### Agent Deployment
- Implement the capability to deploy autonomous agents.

### Add type hints everywhere (make tgpt itself do it?)
