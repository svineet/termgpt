# Design Document: Command-Line Tool for Natural Language to Bash Command Conversion

## Objective

Develop a command-line tool, `tgpt`, that interprets natural language prompts to generate corresponding Bash commands. The tool will offer two modes: direct command execution and an interactive chat mode for iterative command generation. Additionally, it will support internet queries using the `@web` tag.

## Features

### Natural Language Processing

- Interpret user input to generate accurate Bash commands.

### Execution Modes

- **Direct Mode**: Execute the generated Bash command immediately.
- **Chat Mode**: Interactive session for iterative command refinement.

### Internet Query Integration

- Recognize the `@web` tag to perform online searches, enhancing command generation with real-time data.

### Session Management

- In chat mode, maintain conversation history to utilize the OpenAI GPT API effectively.

### Installation and Development

- Ensure the tool is installable and adheres to modern Python development practices.

## Implementation Steps

### Project Initialization

- Set up the project using `uv` for environment and dependency management.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

- Utilize `prompt_toolkit` to create an interactive and user-friendly CLI.

### Natural Language Processing Integration

- Integrate the OpenAI GPT API to process natural language inputs and generate Bash commands.

### Execution Logic

- Implement functionality to execute Bash commands directly from Python.

### Chat Mode Implementation

- Develop an interactive chat mode that maintains session history for context-aware command generation.

### Internet Query Handling

- Implement functionality to detect the `@web` tag and perform internet searches to inform command generation.

### Session Management

- Ensure conversation history is stored securely and used appropriately with the OpenAI GPT API.

### Testing

- Develop a comprehensive test suite to validate all functionalities.

### Documentation

- Create a `README.md` detailing usage instructions, installation steps, and development setup.

## Development Environment Setup

### Python Version Management

- Use `uv` to manage Python versions and virtual environments.

### Dependency Management

- Define project dependencies and manage them using `uv`.

### Code Quality Tools

- Integrate tools like `black`, `flake8`, and `isort` for code formatting and linting.

### Testing Framework

- Use `pytest` for developing and running tests.

### Continuous Integration

- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### Documentation Generation

- Utilize Sphinx for creating project documentation.

## Considerations

### Security

- Implement safeguards to prevent the execution of potentially harmful commands.

### Error Handling

- Ensure the tool gracefully handles errors and provides informative messages to the user.

### Extensibility

- Design the tool to allow for future enhancements, such as support for additional command-line interpreters.

### User Experience

- Focus on creating an intuitive and responsive interface for both direct and chat modes.

By following this design, the `tgpt` tool will provide users with a powerful and user-friendly interface to convert natural language prompts into executable Bash commands, enhancing productivity and accessibility for command-line tasks.
